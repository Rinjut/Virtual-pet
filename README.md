PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This is a simple Virtual Pet Simulator. The project mainly focuses on building a c# code using fundamental programming concepts like basic program structure, console I/O, data types, 
type conversion, and control flow elements. The user can choose a pet type such as a cat, dog, or rabbit.The user can provide the pet's name and display the welcome message containing the pet type and name 
they chose. The user can then perform various actions on the pet, such as feeding it, playing with it, or allowing it to rest. The program also helps the user to understand the pet's status, such as hunger, happiness, or overall health. Each of the following actions provides further insight into the pet's behavior, as outlined below:
  1. Feeding: Decreases hunger, and slightly increases health.
  2. Playing: Increases happiness, slightly increases hunger.
  3. Resting: Improves health, and decreases happiness slightly.
Each action should modify the pet's stats accordingly and display a message describing the action's effect. Additionally, the application offers enhanced functionality for monitoring the pet's health status.
It alerts the user when the pet's health is deteriorating and warns when the status reaches a critical level.

SETUP INSTRUCTION

1. Open Visual Studio and create a new project as "Virtual pet" in C#. 
2. write the C# code as per the requirement and run the project 
3. Execute the code and check each action for the chosen pet to validate if the project works as expected.
4. Create a git repository and Regularly commit the code with descriptive messages. 
5. Once we validate the application, enter 5 to exit from the console terminal and push the code to the git repository.
